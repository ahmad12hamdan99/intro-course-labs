# Kubernetes
## Description
Kubernetes (also known as K8s) is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.

## Purpose and Benefits in DevOps
In a DevOps context, Kubernetes helps manage and orchestrate Docker containers, ensuring they run as intended. It provides a framework to run distributed systems resiliently, scaling and managing failover for your applications, providing deployment patterns, and more. Kubernetes brings with it the benefits of Docker and containerization in general, including consistent, reproducible environments, isolation of applications, and efficient use of resources.

## Key Features and Functionalities
1. Pods: The smallest and simplest unit in the Kubernetes object model that you create or deploy.
2. Services: An abstract way to expose an application running on a set of Pods as a network service.
3. Volumes: A directory with some data, accessible to the containers in a pod.
4. Namespaces: Multiple virtual clusters backed by the same physical cluster.
5. ConfigMaps and Secrets: Allows you to decouple configuration artifacts from image content to keep containerized applications portable.
6. Deployments: Provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.

## Use Cases and Examples
Kubernetes is used in a variety of real-world scenarios:

1. Managing containerized applications: Kubernetes can manage, deploy, and scale containerized applications across a cluster of servers.
2. Microservices architectures: Kubernetes is often used in microservices architectures to orchestrate and deploy individual microservices.
3. CI/CD pipelines: Kubernetes can be used as part of a CI/CD pipeline, automating the deployment, scaling, and management of applications.
4. Scaling applications: Kubernetes can automatically scale applications based on resource usage or other metrics provided through the Metrics Server
