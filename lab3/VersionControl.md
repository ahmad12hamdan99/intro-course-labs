# Version Control Systems

## 1. Definition and Purpose
Version control systems are software tools that help manage changes to source code over time. They keep track of every modification to the code in a special kind of database. If a mistake is made, developers can turn back the clock and compare earlier versions of the code to help fix the mistake while minimizing disruption to all team members.

## 2. Benefits in a Collaborative Environment
- **Track Changes**: Keep a record of who made which changes and when, making it easier to resolve conflicts between concurrent updates.
- **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's work.
- **Backup**: The version control system serves as a backup, which can be vital in cases of local failures.
- **Branching and Merging**: Allow developers to create branches and merge new features into the main codebase only when they are ready to do so.

## 3. Types of Version Control Systems
- **Centralized Version Control System (CVCS)**: Uses a central server to store all files and enables team collaboration. Example: Subversion (SVN).
- **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)**: Each collaborator has a complete copy of the repository. Changes are merged from one to another. Examples: Git, Mercurial.

## 4. Comparison of Popular Systems
- **Git**: Distributed, highly scalable, and efficient in handling projects of any size. It's the most popular system, especially in open-source projects.
- **Subversion (SVN)**: Centralized, better at handling binary files, and provides fine-grained access control.
- **Mercurial**: Similar to Git in being distributed, it's known for its simplicity and ease of use.
